   Test Average Calculator
This Python script calculates the average of two test scores and determines the highest average among all possible pairs of test scores.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.x
## Usage
- Run the script in a Python environment.
- Enter the test scores for Test 1, Test 2, and Test 3 when prompted.
## How it Works
- The script takes three test scores as input and calculates three different averages:
- Average of Test 1 and Test 2
- Average of Test 2 and Test 3
- Average of Test 1 and Test 3
- It then determines and prints the highest average among these three calculated averages.
### Example
- Enter the test marks:
- Test 1 marks: 85
- Test 2 marks: 90
- Test 3 marks: 78
- Highest average: 87.5
